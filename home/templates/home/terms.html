                    <h3>PRICING:</h3>
                    The pricing for graphic design services will be based on the specific project requirements and will be agreed upon in advance between the designer and the client. The pricing will be calculated based on the estimated time and effort required to complete the project, as well as any additional expenses, such as software licenses, stock images or fonts. Any changes to the scope of work will be discussed with the client, and any additional costs will be agreed upon in writing prior to commencing the work.

                    <h3>PAYMENT TERMS:</h3>
                    A deposit of 10% of the total project cost is required before the designer commences any work. The balance of the payment is due upon completion of the project, and prior to delivery of any final files. All invoices are payable within 30 days of the invoice date.

                    <h3>CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICY:</h3>
                    If the client decides to cancel the project before its completion, any work completed up to that point will be invoiced and payable within 30 days of the invoice date. The deposit paid is non-refundable. If the client is not satisfied with the final design, the designer will work with the client to revise the design until the client is satisfied. However, if the client decides to cancel the project after the final design has been approved and delivered, no refunds will be provided.
